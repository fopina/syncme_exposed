https://sync.me/ is one of those (sadly, many) services that started as _contact syncing_ mobile app (to synchronize information between your facebook/linkedin and phonebook contacts) and then, _magically_, became a service that allows you to identify unknown numbers.

Obviously, they have been uploading contacts from every user over the years and now, not only do they provide the information publicly (the users might have consented but their contacts did not) they also blantly monetize it (sell _detailed_ reports).

This is just a repository to save whatever is related to it.
